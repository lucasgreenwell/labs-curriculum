# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?

We clarified a lot of important questions regarding data privacy, user types, and how to safely market to children. We also got a really solid idea of the founding vision behind this application. 

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.

Seems like an outdated question. Parth made the road maps from what I heard. 

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    
My favorite user story for this RC is that a user should be able to read stories in a PDF in the app. 
    This can be broken into a page where a user can read the app, and the app rendering a pdf from the database.  
    
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

I would want to start as high up as possible and slowly narrow my focus to a very small and defined problem.
